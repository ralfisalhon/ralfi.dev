    title: 'A 2D puzzle platformer game with a twist.',
    description: [
      'Red or Blue started as our final project for Professor Jason Wiser’s Game Design class at Tufts University. The game opens with our protagonist falling asleep in his bed and waking up in a dream-like version of his school. Armed with magic 3D glasses, he has to find a way to escape while facing the bullies that harass him in real life. ',
      // 'Traditional 2D platformers often focus on mutating gameplay mechanics, such as giving the player different power ups, in order to change the way the player interacts with the game world. With Red or Blue, we wanted the game world itself to change and for the players to use those changes to their own advantage. Thus, we purposefully limited the player’s abilities so he is relatively powerless and has to rely on the red/blue switching to overcome challenges.',
      // 'On the other hand, we wanted the gameplay to feel smooth and key presses to feel predictable, so we took a page out of Super Mario World’s playbook and standardized all movements to align with the tile map. Finally, we felt like too many modern platformers relied on pure timing and reflex to make their games difficult. This results in frustrating gameplay where the players dying over and over again until they finally beat the level through muscle memory. In Red or Blue, we reward the player for being patient, observant, and for using their memory to tackle puzzles — the challenge comes from discovering the path forward rather than the execution itself.',
      // 'For most of us who made Red or Blue, this was our first time creating a game. We had a lot of fun working on it, and received many praises for its fun mechanics, tight gameplay, and overall polish.',
      'I designed and developed main character and bully animations, created various assets and levels.',
